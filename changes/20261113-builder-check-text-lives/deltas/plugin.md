## MODIFIED Contract
The plugin `clm`, one set of files packaged for Claude Code and for Codex (`agent-harness-adapters`), each installed from this repo's marketplace for that agent harness. It provides, on both:
- the `clm` command on the shell tool's PATH;
- `clm defect`, which reports a defect in CLM itself as `config`'s `defects` setting says: as a backlog item in CLM's own repository, or as an issue filed through the host that the human approves (`defect-reports`, `host-adapters`); its rules are `plugin.hooks`';
- hooks that call `clm hook <name> --agent-harness <agent harness>`, whose rules are `plugin.hooks`': to show the repo's state at session start, with the rule for reporting CLM defects, to have the human confirm `clm approve`, to block cutting releases and pushing to `main`, to have the human approve each defect issue, and to autosync spec work at the end of each turn;
- the skills `propose` (`plugin.propose`), `build` (`plugin.build`), `triage` (`plugin.triage`), `init` (`plugin.init`) and `upgrade` (`plugin.upgrade`), each its child's;
- skill `contribution` (take in a contributor's pull request or issue on the maintainer's side: judge its files, show it to the human, close it or land it on their yes, and credit its author; `clm guide contributions` says why);
- skill `help` (answer a person's questions about CLM, read-only, from what the installed `clm` carries: the guide, `clm guide constraints` and, in a repository under CLM, its state; it points at the skill that acts and changes nothing);
- skill `health` (run `clm health`, summarise its sections for the human, launch `spec-slimmer` on each component its bloat signals mark, and list what to take to `propose`: the reconsider candidates and the cuts; it changes nothing itself);
- skill `configure` (review CLM's settings or change one);
- skill `verify` (verify `origin/main` as it is now, triggers aside, with `clm verify --commit origin/main`; on a red result show the failing step and its last lines, re-run the failing tests when it can, and offer to take the failure in at `P1`);
- the subagents `spec-auditor`, `architecture-auditor`, `spec-slimmer` and `issue-verifier`, which are `plugin.agents`'.

The rules several skills share are this component's, though the files they constrain are its children's. What each asks of the skills:
- `skills`: `propose` and `build` never push `main` by any means but `clm land`, and run `clm approve` only after the human's yes, through the guard; no skill or agent names `clm hash`, only `clm hashes`;
- `architecture-audit`: `propose` launches the `architecture-auditor` beside its builder check before its pull request, and `contribution` launches the auditor too; the builder check itself is `plugin.propose`'s (`plugin.propose/builder-check`), and `build`'s loop keeps the `question` and `human-task` items that block what it leaves in the human's queue (`orchestrator.loop/humans-queue`);
- `session-worktrees`: `propose` and `init` cut each branch in a worktree of its own under `.claude/worktrees/`, never switching the checkout the session started in, except in a session already isolated there; `triage` cuts its archive branch the same way, a rule its own requirement states (`plugin.triage/triage-archives-complete`);
- `defect-check-before-pr`: `propose` reviews the session for CLM defects before any pull request and fixes the reported ones once its branches have landed; `build`, which opens no pull request, reports each when it happens, and its loop drafts them with the backlog's other bugs (`orchestrator.loop/plan-order`);
- `recommend-the-right-design`: `triage` and `propose` read the specs and code before recommending, and recommend the correct design over the convenient one;
- `skills-write-serves` and `skills-write-enforcement`: `propose` and `init` give components `serves`, and constraints `#### Enforced by` or `#### Untested`;
- `launch-models`: every subagent a skill launches has its model named;
- `skills-follow-agent-harness`: every skill reads `clm agent-harness` and follows what the agent harness can do, in words no single agent harness owns;
- `skills-push-with-clm`: no skill says `git push`; pushes and remote deletes go through `clm branch push` and `clm branch delete`;
- `unattended-permissions-check` and `skills-run-verify`: `build` and `triage` check the allow rules before their first launch; `triage` runs `clm verify --due --event work-done` before `clm wrap-up`, and `build`'s loop runs `clm verify` when the project's triggers say (`orchestrator.loop/plan-verify`);
- `wrap-up-left-lines`: a skill that runs `clm wrap-up` passes each `left` line to the human and never prunes a worktree itself;
- `method-pointers`: no skill or agent names `docs/guide/` but `propose`'s two pages, each `clm guide <page>` named is a page, and `init` explains graph shape before the first component map;
- `renamed-commands`, `says-architectural-constraint`, `skills-say-new-words` and `skills-say-component`: every file under `plugin/` uses the current command names, terms and words.

This component's build never edits a child's file (`path-ownership`). A rule that asks something of one child's file alone is that child's requirement, never this component's, as `plugin.propose/builder-check` is. A change to a shared rule adds a requirement to each child whose file must change, and the shared rule's `#### Needs` names them, so it waits until each child has built its part (`dependency-work-is-a-requirement`, `requirement-needs`).

The CLM panel, a second plugin `clm-panel` in the Claude Code marketplace, is `plugin.panel`; it is Claude Code's alone.

The plugin's version is the `clm` version it runs, in both packages. Users update with `claude plugin update clm`, or Codex's own plugin update, and the new version's shim downloads its binary on first use.

An agent of the generic tier, which has no package, gets CLM from the `clm` binary and the project's `AGENTS.md` alone (`platform`).

The skills carry CLM's method to every adopter (`method-in-the-plugin`): what they don't say themselves, they point at as a page of the guide that `clm guide <page>` prints, never as a path in this repository.
