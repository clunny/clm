## MODIFIED Contract
`clm affected [--base <ref>] [--root <dir>] [--readers | --why <path>]` prints what a change can break, read from the spec graph (`graph-test-selection`): the components it affects and the files whose tests a check should run, or that every test must run. It knows no test runner; the project's check command turns the files into its runner's arguments (`ci`), and `clm land` hands it the output (`land`).

- The *changed files* are the paths that differ between the merge base of `<ref>` (default `origin/main`) and `HEAD`, and the working tree, with the untracked files git doesn't ignore, leaving out every path `ledger`'s `doc_only` names. A deleted file is a changed file.
- When a changed file matches a glob of `config`'s `[affected] all`, or no component's `paths` hold it (`check`'s `owner` gives none), the output is one line, `all <file>`, naming the first such file in path order.
- Otherwise the *affected* components are the owners of the changed files, every component that depends on one of them, directly or indirectly (`depends_on`). The output is a *component line* for each affected component, the word `component-words` keeps for these lines followed by a space and the component's ID, which `ci`'s check script and `clm land` read, then `file <path>` for each selected file, each group sorted, and nothing when no file changed.
- The *selected* files are the changed files that still exist, whatever their content, the files `check`'s coverage scan reads (tracked, or untracked and not ignored; UTF-8; Markdown left out) that hold a `req:` marker whose requirement ID names an affected component (the part before `/`, whether or not the requirement still exists), or that hold no `req:` marker and whose `owner` is affected, and the *readers*.
- A *reader* is a file the coverage scan reads that holds a `clm:reads <glob>` marker (`doc-readers-marked`) whose glob matches a path that differs as the changed files do, doc-only paths included: a test that reads the repository's own files, such as its specs or `ARCHITECTURE.md`, names them so, since `code_key` leaves the doc-only ones out and nothing else connects the test to them. `--readers` prints the readers' `file` lines alone, with no component or `all` line, which `clm land` runs on a tree whose code was already checked.
- `--why <path>` prints why the change selects `<path>`, as the chain from the file to a changed file, one link per line (`why-chain`), which the library offers as `why(root, base, path)`. `clm land` runs it to explain a step's cost (`land/check-time-report`).

It exits 0 with its output, 1 with the reason when `--readers` and `--why` are both given, when `<ref>` doesn't resolve to a commit, when it has no merge base with `HEAD`, or when the graph or the settings can't be loaded, and 2 when git fails otherwise.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: affected-components <!-- base: 3230aae2280aca77 -->
`clm affected` SHALL print a component line (the Contract's) for each component that owns a changed file (`check.coverage/owner`) and for each component that depends on one of those, directly or indirectly, sorted by ID, and for no other component.

#### Scenario: dependants
- GIVEN a root with no dependencies, components `a`, `b` depending on `a`, `c` depending on `b`, and `d` depending on nothing, and a branch that changes only `crates/a/src/lib.rs`, which `a`'s `paths` hold
- WHEN `clm affected --base main` runs on the branch
- THEN it prints the component lines of `a`, `b` and `c`, and no other component line

#### Scenario: nothing changed
- GIVEN a branch with no commits beyond `main` and a clean working tree
- WHEN `clm affected --base main` runs
- THEN it prints nothing and exits 0

#### Needs
- check/path-ownership
- check.coverage/owner
