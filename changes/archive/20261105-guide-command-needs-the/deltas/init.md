## MODIFIED Contract

Bringing a repository under CLM (`init-cli-and-skill`). The deterministic half; the conversation and the drafting are `plugin`'s `/clm:init` skill.

- `clm init [--lang <language>]... [--no-detectors] [--host none|git|github]` sets up CLM's tooling in the CLM repository found from the current directory, or at the top of the git repository when there is none (`init-root`), and prints the steps only a human can do. Run again, even after upgrading `clm`, it regenerates nothing: every file it writes belongs to the project once written, since no workflow is generated (`land-locally`). The one file it edits rather than writes whole is `.gitignore`, to which it adds each of `clm.local.toml`, `.clm/` and `.claude/worktrees/` that git doesn't already ignore there, or all three when it has no `.gitignore` (`local-settings`, `init-ignores-session-files`). The root component it writes owns the files `clm init` writes, and sets `outside`, which turns on `clm check`'s path ownership, to the repository's existing code, so the bootstrap commit passes it before the first spec graph lands (`incremental-adoption`).
- `clm survey` prints a compact map of the CLM repository found from the current directory, or of the whole git repository when there is none (`root-from-cwd`), for drafting its spec graph (`brownfield-survey`). `clm survey --components <file>` checks a proposed component map against the code and exits 1 with what's wrong. The map may leave part of the code for later, as `outside` globs, as the root's `outside` does (`incremental-adoption`); it checks coverage over the same code files `clm check`'s path ownership reads, so a map it accepts passes that rule once written as the spec graph.
- `import_edges(root)`, a library call, returns the file-to-file import edges `clm survey` finds in the repository at `root`, for `check`'s `undeclared-imports` rule, which `clm check` runs on the spec graph's own components (`undeclared-imports`).
- `clm guide [<page>]` prints CLM's guide, the pages of `docs/guide/` and the spec format, `docs/spec-format.md`, compiled into the binary, and the page `constraints`, generated from CLM's carried constraints: with no page, the index of page names and titles; with one, that page's Markdown (`method-in-the-plugin`, `guide-in-the-binary`, `spec-format-in-the-guide`). It reads no file at run time, so it works offline, in any repository or none, and prints the guide of the version that runs. No link in the guide leads outside it, so every link works in an adopter's project and in `clm guide`'s output.

Files `clm init` writes, each only when missing, and the one it adds lines to:

| File | Owner |
|---|---|
| `clm.toml` | project |
| `scripts/clm-check.sh` | project |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CAPABILITIES.md`, `specs/SPEC.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | project |
| `.gitignore`: the lines `clm.local.toml`, `.clm/` and `.claude/worktrees/`, each added when missing | project |

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: guide-command <!-- base: 07905d3cdbc09e29 -->
`clm guide` SHALL print one line per page of the guide, as compiled into the binary, each `<name>  <title>`. The pages SHALL be every `.md` file in `docs/guide/`, `docs/spec-format.md` and the generated page `constraints` (`guide-constraints-page`), whose title is `CLM's constraints`; `<name>` is the file name without `.md` (`index` for `README.md`) and `<title>` the page's first `# ` heading; `index` SHALL come first, then the pages `README.md`'s numbered list names, in its order, then `spec-format`, then `constraints`. For a page read from a file, every page but `constraints`, `clm guide <name>` SHALL print its Markdown exactly as its file is at build time, and exit 0; `clm guide constraints` prints the page `guide-constraints-page` states. For a name that isn't a page it SHALL exit 1, printing `no guide page <name>` and the index to stderr. It SHALL read no file at run time.

#### Scenario: index
- GIVEN the binary built from this repository
- WHEN `clm guide` runs in a directory that isn't in a repository
- THEN it exits 0, its first line names `index`, one line is `shaping-the-graph  Shaping the graph`, its second-to-last line is `spec-format  Spec format (v0, provisional)` and its last line is `constraints  CLM's constraints`

#### Scenario: one page
- GIVEN the binary built from this repository
- WHEN `clm guide shaping-the-graph` runs
- THEN it prints `docs/guide/shaping-the-graph.md` byte for byte and exits 0

#### Scenario: the spec format
- GIVEN the binary built from this repository
- WHEN `clm guide spec-format` runs
- THEN it prints `docs/spec-format.md` byte for byte and exits 0

#### Scenario: unknown page
- GIVEN the binary
- WHEN `clm guide no-such-page` runs
- THEN it exits 1 and stderr holds `no guide page no-such-page` and the index

#### Scenario: page left out
- GIVEN a `.md` file in `docs/guide/` that the compiled table doesn't hold
- WHEN the tests run
- THEN a test fails naming the file
