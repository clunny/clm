## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: pending-report <!-- base: 0ca7a745fb31bac9 -->
`clm pending [<component>]` SHALL print one line per pending requirement of every component, or of `<component>`, sorted by component ID then requirement ID: `<id> <version> unbuilt`, `<id> <version> behind <cited>[,<cited>...]` with the versions its markers cite other than its current one (`none` for a marker without one), sorted, or `<id> obsolete <file>:<line>[ ...]`; each followed by ` blocked <blocker>[,<blocker>...]` when it is blocked, each blocker `backlog/<slug>` for a backlog item that names it in `blocks` or `<component>/<slug>` for a pending requirement its `Needs` name (`requirement-needs`), for an `obsolete` one a pending requirement a move took it to, or for a capability a requirement serving it that holds it back, items first, each group sorted. An `obsolete` requirement SHALL be blocked by each pending requirement that the moves `status-report` defines take it to, followed as `progress-follows-moves` follows them to the IDs the spec holds, on whatever component each is (`moved-markers-wait`): the build of that requirement re-points the markers, so the obsolete line waits for it. A capability that is pending SHALL count as pending on the component that builds the capabilities' tests, which `pending` takes from the model's `Graph::capability_tests_node` (`model/capability-tests-component`) rather than deciding itself, and is blocked like any requirement by the items whose `blocks` name it. A pending capability, `unbuilt` or `behind`, SHALL also be blocked by each requirement whose effective serves (`model/serves`) names it, on whatever component, optional or not, that is `unbuilt`, or `behind` and itself blocked, by an item whose `blocks` names it or by any requirement in its own `waits_on`, whatever that requirement's state and whatever blocks it in turn; and by no current one, nor any `behind` one that nothing blocks (`serving-rules-order-capabilities`). So its test is built after the rules it exercises, and isn't offered while a changed rule it exercises waits on other work. A capability holding `#### Untested` is never pending, and neither is an architecture entry: the rules its `#### Enforced by` names are pending on their own components (`human-layer-proof`). It SHALL exit 0, printing nothing when nothing is pending, or print the violations and exit 1 when the spec graph has violations. An `obsolete` marker whose ID names a component the spec graph doesn't hold SHALL count as pending on the component `owner` gives for the marker's file, or on the root `clm` when it gives none, however the component went: removed by a delta with `remove: true` (`node-removal`) or gone without one. A removed requirement cited in files of several components is pending on each of them, each line listing only that component's files. `pending(graph, markers)` SHALL return the same for a graph and markers loaded without a checkout, with each requirement's priority, the slugs of the items that block it in `blocked_by`, and its other blockers, as `<component>/<slug>` in the order `clm pending` prints them, in `waits_on`: the requirements its `Needs` name, those a move took an `obsolete` one to, and the rules a capability waits on, in one list (`priority-orders-nodes` seeds through each).

- WHEN `clm pending clm` runs
- THEN it prints `g/x obsolete old/t.rs:4`

#### Scenario: component gone without a removal delta
- GIVEN no component `g`, an `applied` change whose delta for `g` lists `g/x` under `REMOVED Requirements` without `remove: true`, a marker at `crates/v/t.rs:1` citing `g/x`, and component `v` with `paths` `["crates/v/**"]`
